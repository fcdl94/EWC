# Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks
[OnlineEWC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06370.pdf) and [EWC++](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Arslan_Chaudhry__Riemannian_Walk_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) implementations, the online versions of [Elastic weight consolidation](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7051-overcoming-catastrophic-forgetting-by-incremental-moment-matching.pdf)

In the ipynb are present three methods: vanilla (no incremental class learning techniques applied), Online EWC, and EWC++.
The methods are tested on Split MNIST dataset that is made of 5 incremental tasks, where each task is made by two sequential digits.
